        // in the next line of code what is essentially happening is that well first we are making this picker of type uiimagepickercontroller and what that it essentially does is that it gives us all the properties of the uiimagepickercontroller within this picker controller and then from there we make it its own delegate and like we said that gives us our own set of blueprints and in the next line of code we are basically saying that we can allow editing meaning if they can modify the existing image

    // In the next several lines of code we are setting up a reference to the users identification and saying that with that snapshot of data we want to grab the username value of the user and set that equal to the username text label that is in their profile to display their username and cast it as a string so it is readble by other users

        // In the next line of code we are declaring a new let constant called logInViewController and what this let constant essentially does is that we take the storyboard constant that we declared in the previous line of code and what we do with that is that we are using this new let constant we are declaring to reprsent the transition that occurs when the the user wants to go from wherever they are in the main storyboard and go to the view controller they want to end up in by giving the view controller an identifier for where they want to end up in and depending on where you call this function that how the transition is going to occur for example we call this function in the log out button action because when we press the logout button we want to be transition to the view controller that we gave the identifier for
